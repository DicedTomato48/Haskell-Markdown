Hello my name is **Arya** and this is an _italic_ text with ~~strike~~ and a footnote: [^1] with link directed to somewhere [Google](https://google.com).
Next we have `print("Hello")` which is print in python language and `cout << "Hello << endl;` in cpp programming language.
This is weird nested modifiers **~~~~** with **~~_`Code, Bold, Italic and Strike`_~~**
